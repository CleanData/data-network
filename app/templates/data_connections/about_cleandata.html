		<h3>About Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span></h3>
		<p>Analysts and data scientists spend most of their time cleaning data. What we realised was that a lot of that time is spent cleaning the same data. What if you could find the data someone else has already cleaned?</p>
		<p>Suddenly the problem isn't about data cleaning, but instead about data discovery. If you can find the data someone else has already cleaned, you save hours, weeks or months of duplicated effort.</p>
		<h4>What's in it for <span class='highlight'>data scientists</span>?</h4>
		<p>Every data scientist responsible for datasets has a profile page. If your datasets are highly used - or if you use a popular dataset in unusual ways - Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span> will highlight that.</p><p>Physicists live by their citation count. Developers reference the number of times their Github project has been forked. Data Scientists should be able to point to the projects that rely on their data, and show off the value they add to open datasets. Now you can.</p>
		<h4>What's in it for <span class='highlight'>industry</span>?</h4>
		<p>Datasets don't need to be public to be represented in Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span> If you have a commercial dataset that's used in applications around the world - add it to Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span> When people ask about the value of the dataset, you can quickly reference who uses it, and where.</p>
		<h4>What's in it for <span class='highlight'>government</span>?</h4>
		<p>The open data movement is strong and growing stronger. But where is that data used? Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span> offers an easy way to track and visualize the spread of open data. Tracking the use of open data is the first step to quantifying the value generated by open data.</p>
		<h4>How did Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span> come about?</h4>
		<p>Clean<span class='highlight'>.</span>Data<span class='highlight'>.</span> originated at the <a href='http://energy.gov/videos/data-jam-new-york-energy-week'>New York Energy Week Data Jam</a> in 2013. A team of nine people from industry, academia and government met and found that they shared a common problem finding clean datasets. The project was adopted as an initiative of Energy Infotech NYC.</p>
		<p>The team from the Data Jam are Jon Roberts, Honey Berk, Sue Purvis, Barry Korn, Simon Sylvester-Chaudry, Matt Garcia, Tyler Wunsch, Mark Doolin and Mike Shimazu. The project is grateful for the support of <a href="http://www.energysolutionsforum.com/">Energy Solutions Forum</a>.</p>
